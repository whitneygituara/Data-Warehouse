# Simple Data Warehouse using Python, Pandas, and SQLite3 🗄️
(Whitney Gituara - 671528)

This project shows **step by step** how to build a very simple **data warehouse** in Python.  
This readme is beginner friendly.

We use:

- **SQLite3** → a lightweight database included with Python (no installation needed)  
- **Pandas** → a powerful library for handling data in tables (like Excel)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → libraries for creating beautiful charts  
- **NumPy** → a library for working with numbers and arrays

## 🧾 What is a Data Warehouse?

A **data warehouse** is like a **big storage room** where data from different sources is collected and organized so it can be analyzed later.  

In this beginner example:

- We create a **database** (using SQLite3).  
- We store a small **table of employee data** in it.  
- We **analyze the data** (average, missing values, statistics).  
- We **visualize it** (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots).

## 📂 What’s Inside?

- `Day-1.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with the full code and explanations  
- `data_warehouse.db` → database file that is automatically created when you run the code  
- (You can also copy the code into `main.py` if you prefer running a Python script)

- Python 3.8+  
- Jupyter Notebook (or any Python IDE like VSCode, PyCharm, etc.)
